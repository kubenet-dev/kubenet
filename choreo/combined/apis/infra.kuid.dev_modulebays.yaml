          A ModuleBay serves as a modular slot or enclosure within a Node, designed to accommodate additional modules.
          ModuleBays provide a flexible and scalable approach to extending the capabilities of Nodes,
          allowing users to customize and enhance their infrastructure deployments according to specific requirements.

                        This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

                        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be
                        useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
